 * FAVICON IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * To make the Pakistan flag appear in the browser tab, follow these steps:
 *
 * 1. Download these Pakistan flag favicon images:
 *    - Pakistan flag favicon: https://www.countryflags.com/wp-content/uploads/pakistan-flag-png-large.png
 *    - Or any Pakistan flag image you prefer
 *
 * 2. Create the following files and place them in your project's public folder:
 *
 *    - favicon.png - Main favicon (64x64 pixels recommended)
 *    - favicon-16x16.png - Small favicon (16x16 pixels)
 *    - favicon-32x32.png - Medium favicon (32x32 pixels)
 *    - apple-touch-icon.png - For iOS devices (180x180 pixels)
 *
 * 3. You can resize the Pakistan flag image using:
 *    - Online tools like https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
 *    - Image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.NET
 *
 * 4. For the best results, use PNG format with transparency
 *
 * 5. If you're deploying to Vercel, make sure these files are in the public folder
 *    before deploying
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The layout.tsx file is already configured to use these files.
 * You just need to create and add them to your project.
